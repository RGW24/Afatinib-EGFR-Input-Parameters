# Afatinib-EGFR-Input-Parameters
This repository contains all the files used in the simulation of Afatinib-EGFR binding using AMBER Force Field. The initial structure of Afatinib used for optimization, the protein structure downloaded from PDB Database, and the structure used for covalent binding approximation is added in the first folder. The second folder contains the input protein file used for docking and the associated docking parameters. The third folder contains all the files for running the simulations implemented in the study and calculating the thermodynamic parameters. The fourth folder contains the python code used for determining the Interaction Entropy and the C2 Entropy.
