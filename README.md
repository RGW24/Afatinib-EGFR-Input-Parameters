# Afatinib-EGFR-Input-Parameters
This repository contains all the files used in the simulation of Afatinib-EGFR binding using AMBER Force Field 
The initial structure of Afatinib used for optimization and that of protein downloaded from PDB Database is added in the first file
The second file contains the input protein file used in MD simulation run
The third file constains all the main scripts (in BASH) for launching and analyzing the simulations implemented in the study along with relevant topology and parameter files
