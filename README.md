# Afatinib-EGFR-Input-Parameters
This repository contains all the files used in the simulation of Afatinib-EGFR binding using AMBER Force Field. 
The initial structure of Afatinib used for optimization and that of protein downloaded from PDB Database is added in the first folder.
The second folder contains the input protein file used in docking along with docking parameters.
The third file constains all the files for launching and analyzing the simulations implemented in the study.
